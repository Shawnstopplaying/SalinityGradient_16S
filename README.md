# How does salt influence microbial communicaties?

Question:

1. How is microbial biodiversity midified acorss a salinity gradient?
   -Null Hypothesis: Microbial biodiversity such as richness does not cary along a salinity gradient.
   -Hypothesis: Microbial richness will increase with lower salt concentration.
                There is an inverse relationship between richness and salinity. 
2. How does microbial composition change across a salinity gradient?
   -Null Hypothesis: Microbial composion does not change across a salinity gradient.
   -Hypothesis: Dominant members of the microbial community are unique in freshwater conpared to salt water.
